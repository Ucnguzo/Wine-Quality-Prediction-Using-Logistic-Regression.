The objective of this project was to build a predictive model to classify the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties. The dataset provided included various features derived from physicochemical tests and a quality score. Given the challenges of a smaller dataset and potential imbalance, a Logistic Regression model was trained and evaluated.
Challenges: Smaller dataset and potential imbalance.
Solution: Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model.
